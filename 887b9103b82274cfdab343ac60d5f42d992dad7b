- updated to 0.81 (new stable release),
- use CXX=%{__cc} so now sablotron isn't will be linked with libstdc++ because
  libsablotron do not uses any libstdc++ abilities,
- as consequense above: remove libstdc++-devel from BuildRequires,
- merge Conectiva translations,
- libsablotron0{,-devel} added to Obsoletes for allow upgrade from MDK,
- added lib*.la to devel %files list.
